    <h2>The most authentic, perfect Neapolitan pizza recipe!</h2>
    <p>This is perhaps the most authentic Neapolitan pizza recipe you will find! What’s more, it’s really easy with just 4 ingredients; flour, water, salt, and yeast.</p>
    <p>Authentic Neapolitan pizza originates from the birthplace of pizza, Naples. It involves simple ingredients and traditional methods that have been largely forgotten for quite a while. Luckily it is bouncing back, with many people finding this beautiful style of pizza for the first time.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients (makes 4 10" pizzas)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Flour</b> - 640g</li>
        <li><b>Water (room temperature)</b> - 360g</li>
        <li><b>Salt (fine)</b> - 14g</li>
        <li><b>Yeast (dried or fresh)</b> - around 0.2g to 0.5g instantt yeast (<a href="https://mypizzacorner.com/pizza-dough-calculator/">check yeast calculator here</a>) - multiply by 3 for fresh yeast.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions for preparing the dough</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix all the ingredients into a shaggy mass in a large bowl, starting by adding the water first. You can do this by hand or use a wooden spoon.</li>
        <li>Cover the bowl with cling film, a plastic carrier bag, or a damp cloth (if the cloth isn’t damp the dough may dry out).</li>
        <li>Leave the dough to rest for around 1 hour (the technical term for this process is the Autolyse).</li>
        <li>Turn the dough out onto the counter and knead for around 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place the dough back into the bowl and cover tightly.</li>
        <li>Leave the dough to prove (in one big lump, don’t worry too much about the shape) for around 20 hours at room temperature.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into 4 equal parts (250g each) using some kitchen scales and a knife (or dough scraper). Do this about 4 hours before you intend to cook the pizza (after about a 20 hour prove).</li>
        <li>Place each dough ball into a small bowl and cover. Alternatively, use a large tupperware container with a lid, or two smaller ones.</li>
        <li>Leave the dough balls to prove again for about 4-6 hours.</li>
    </ol>
