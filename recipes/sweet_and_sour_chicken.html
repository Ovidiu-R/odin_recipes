    <h2>About sweet and sour chicken</h2>
    <p>There are many different styles of sweet and sour dishes that date back centuries from China, as well as the Philippines and Korea.</p>
    <p>How it came to be that it’s now a rather orange sauce in the UK though is anyone’s guess! As it’s evolved, we are more familiar with a bright, sticky sauce that was ranked #4 in a survey of Brits’ favourite takeaways during lockdown. This report suggests that the origins may have come from Shanghai and interestingly, the sauce was then black in colour.</p>
    <p>This is my take on Sweet and Sour Chicken, focused on flavour, convenience, cost, and as always, family friendliness.</p>
